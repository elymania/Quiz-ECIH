    <p>
      I am CERT Manager at a company that provides incident response and Cyber Threat Intelligence services.
      I have a master's degree in computer engineering, cybersecurity and artificial intelligence
      from the University of Cagliari. In addition to managing cyber incident response, I am
      responsible for coordinating the Intelligence team to anticipate threats that may affect
      organizations, and I help customers develop a cybersecurity strategy in line with the National
      Security Framework. I am familiar with NIS compliance, GDPR, AGID, the National Security Perimeter,
      and cyber risk management. The CERT (Computer Emergency Response Team) in which I work is
      responsible for responding promptly to incidents, not only with EDR support, but also with Digital
      Forensics acquisition methods, malware analysis, and threat hunting techniques. My team, composed
      of threat hunters and CTI analysts, constantly analyzes the threat landscape and vulnerabilities,
      providing useful executive reports to CISOs and decision makers on controls to add and budgets to
      allocate to security.
